FLEX stands for Fitness, Learn and Excel. It is a social-media platform made for people that want to improve their fitness
journey. Whether it be gym training, running, basketball, or any other physical activity, FLEX allows users to interact socially,
share progress and stay motivated in their fitness goals. The platform connects both social media and fitness tracking by
integrating features that promote social interaction and goal achievement. FLEX incorporates calendar and schedule-maker
features within the platform to help users stay organised, allowing them to plan workouts and stay consistent. Users can set
definitive goals, create custom plans and track their commitment to the structured routines.
Fundamentally, the FLEX platform has a messaging system for users to communicate and connect with others on the same
wavelength. Users can find, message and friend other people on the platform by filtering using specific sports/activities. There is a
group option where groups can be public or private and customized accordingly. These groups are used to talk about problems,
offer solutions, and share stories that may help others in the community. As FLEX is a social platform, profiles are made with bios
and people have the opportunity to make posts for community engagement. There is a message board and user-created
polls/surveys to foster community interaction to help others with their fitness goals
